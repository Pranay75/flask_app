# Configuration

Configure your Flask application by setting up the environment variables.

-  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Ensure the `.env` file contains the following:
    ```plaintext
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin_username
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin_password
    ```

Refer to [Running the Application](./running.md) to start the server.
